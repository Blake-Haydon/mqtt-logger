## Description

`mqtt-logger` allows for asynchronous data logging of MQTT messages to a SQLite database. It also allows for the playback of previously recorded MQTT messages.

## Installation

To install `mqtt-logger` you can simply use `pip`.

```bash
pip install mqtt-logger
```

## Example Usage

### Recording MQTT Messages

This example records messages to the `test/#` topic using a public MQTT broker. It will record for 10 seconds. If you
are using a private broker, you may need to set the `username` and `password` parameters.

<!-- poetry run python examples/10s_recording.py -->

_Example recorder taken from [examples/10s_recording.py](examples/10s_recording.py)_

```python
import mqtt_logger
import os
import time

# Initalise mqtt recorder object
rec = mqtt_logger.Recorder(
    sqlite_database_path=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "MQTT_log.db"),
    topics=["test/#"],
    broker_address="broker.hivemq.com",
    verbose=True,
)

# Start the logger, wait 10 seconds and stop the logger
rec.start()
time.sleep(10)
rec.stop()
```

This example records messages using a TLS connection.

```python
import mqtt_logger
import os
import time

# Initalise mqtt recorder object
rec = mqtt_logger.Recorder(
    sqlite_database_path=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "MQTT_log.db"),
    topics=["test/#"],
    broker_address="broker.hivemq.com",
	port=8883,
	use_tls=True,
	tls_insecure=False,
    verbose=True,
)

# Start the logger, wait 10 seconds and stop the logger
rec.start()
time.sleep(10)
rec.stop()
```


### Playback Recorded MQTT Messages

This example plays back previously recorded MQTT messages from `mqtt_logger.Recorder`. If you are using a private
broker, you may need to set the `username` and `password` parameters.

<!-- poetry run python examples/10s_playback.py -->

_Example recorder taken from [examples/10s_playback.py](examples/10s_playback.py)_

```python
import mqtt_logger
import os

# Initalise playback object
playback = mqtt_logger.Playback(
    sqlite_database_path=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "MQTT_log.db"),
    broker_address="broker.hivemq.com",
    verbose=True,
)

# Start playback at 2x speed (twice as fast)
playback.play(speed=2)
```

## Database

The SQLite database has two tables called `LOG` and `RUN`. The `LOG` table contains the messages that are being logged. The `RUN` table contains the information about the current run of the program.

### `LOG` Table

| ROW NAME  | DESCRIPTION                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ID        | Unique number assigned to each message (ascending int) |
| RUN_ID    | ID of the current run (ascending int)                  |
| UNIX_TIME | Time when the message was received                     |
| TOPIC     | MQTT topic                                             |
| MESSAGE   | MQTT message received                                  |

---

### `RUN` Table

| ROW NAME        | DESCRIPTION                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ID              | Unique number assigned to run (ascending int) |
| START_UNIX_TIME | Time when logger was started                  |
| END_UNIX_TIME   | Time when logger was stopped                  |
